Implement tests from http://www.sanfoundry.com/5-practical-csplit-command-usage-examples-in-linux/
It should use system csplit and target/build/csplit, execute tests, save output to directory and make a diff.
If there is a difference in results, test failed.

Steps for script:

1.  Collect output and files for system csplit:
mkdir system_test1
cd system_test1
csplit ../sample.txt PATTERN > test1.out 2>&1

2. Collect output and files for built csplit
mkdir rust_test1 
cd rust_test1
csplit ../sample.txt PATTERN > test1.out 2>&1

// Now run diff
diff system_test1 rust_test1

// Tests are:
csplit sample.txt 5
csplit sample.txt /4/
csplit sample.txt /Line/
csplit sample.txt 1 {7}
csplit sample.txt 2 {7}
csplit -f xyz sample.txt 6
csplit sample.txt /Line/ {*}
